Explorer : 
- Changed initial values for these settings : voice commands are disabled by default, annotations are visible in the checklist tool by default, Annotate Tool photo mode is set to "With and Without model" by default
- Annotate Tool : Now defaults to a "simple" mode, old settings are still accessible by enabling "Advanced mode". Simple mode always uses the default settings
- Annotate Tool : Revamped the display of annotations. Added a smart layout system that avoids overlapping annotations. In addition, viewpoints from the same annotation are grouped together when possible
- Annotate Tool : After finishing an annotation, the tool now goes back to the new annotation menu instead of the main menu
- Added a model luminosity setting. Similar to the luminosity setting on the HoloLens device itself, but only affects the model and not menus
