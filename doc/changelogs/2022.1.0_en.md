v2022.1.0 Changelog

English :

Explorer : 
- New language for NEXT-BIM Explorer : French 
- Global offset : A vertical offset can be pre-configured in NEXT-BIM Configurator (can also be adjusted in NEXT-BIM Explorer) to offset the model from the real world by a specific height when using the Snap Tool and during the Continuous Matching

- Reworked the circular menu : new icons, better organization, improved ergonomy
- Menus can now be scrolled using click & drag (like a touch screen)
- Increased Visibility Tool & Info Tool menu size for better usability
- The height of the user is now properly detected, the floor of the model will now be aligned with the real world when first going in Immersive mode
- Added reminders when the current license is expiring soon
- Added terms of service at first launch
- Fixed checklist crash when using custom states defined in NEXT-BIM Configurator
- The hand ray visuals should now more accurately stop at objects you can interact with (especially in the checklist tool)
- Fixed measures staying visible in the Annotate Tool after taking an annotation with the "Show measures" option activated

Configurator & Converter :
- Added Filters & Shared Filter Library : A filter is a combination of rules used to find a particular set of objects. Filters are saved in project files and can be shared between projects with the Shared Filters Library. When reopening a project with updated IFC files, the filters automatically update the set of objects.
Filters can be used for most of NEXT-BIM Configurator's functions like materials, visibility lists, checklists, etc...
For the initial release, available rules are : Name, Type, File, Storey, Property and Object List. Rules are combined using logical operators.
Example : *In file : __CVC__* AND *In buidling storey : __02__* AND *Property __System Name__ == __Cold Water__*

- Massive RAM usage reduction
- Improved cached files loading time
- Improved NBIM generation time
- Better conflict detection : Object GUID conflicts between files are now detected and can be resolved by the user (various selection options are available in a file's context menu)
- Cache settings : added a list view of all cached files with associated ifc files
- When multiple materials are applied to the same object, they will now combine if applicable (Priority is first Object material then Type material then File material)
- Added a better mesh simplifier and shape detector for creating colliders (especially for objects with a very high triangle density) to improve performance and reduce RAM usage in NEXT-BIM Explorer
- Fixed missing properties in IfcElementQuantity property sets
